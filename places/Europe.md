## Washrooms

In Europe, public washrooms are usually not free, even in some malls. Most of them are still coin operated. If you need to find a washroom, try:

- train/subway station
- coffee shop or fast food restaurant

  You may need to make a purchase there

- hotels

  They usually have a washroom somewhere on the ground floor, try going in like you're staying there and hope no one stops you.

## Floor Numbering

In Europe, the floor you enter on is called the ground floor instead of the first floor, labeled as 0 or G. The floor above it is called the first floor.

## Train Passes

Trains are a great way to get around Europe. Stations are usually in the city center, and you don't have to deal with security or check-in. If you're planning on taking more than a few train rides, a train pass can save you money. [eurail](https://www.eurail.com/en) offers train passes for Europe to non-Europeans. Some routes require reservations, which are not included in the pass. (Usually for high-speed trains. Around €10-€20 per reservation.) Note that passes like "7 days in 1 month" are for 7 non-consecutive days of train travel within a month.

## Tipping

Every country in Europe do tipping differently. Check [this list](https://www.explorationjunkie.com/tipping-etiquette-around-the-world/#list) and city specific guides for more info.

## Cell Data

EU law bans EU carriers from charging for roaming within the EU. However Switzerland and the UK are not in the EU, so check your eSIM or SIM card provider to see if it includes those countries. Some UK carriers now have caps on roaming in the EU.

## Flying

Buget airlines sometimes fly to small airports with misleading names. For example, "Stockholm Västerås" is actually 103km from Stockholm, 90-minute shuttle bus ride away, the bus only comes 1 or 2 time a day. Figure out how to get from the airport to the city center before booking.
