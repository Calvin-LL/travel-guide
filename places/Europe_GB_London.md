## At the airport

### Heathrow

#### SIM card

**Avoid** SIM Local at arrivals, save yourself ¬£5 service charge by going to a WHSmith or SIM card vending machine. If you're at Terminal 2, there's a vending machine right outside the arrivals area next to the elevator on your way to the tube station.

#### Getting to the city

| Type     | Method                            | Time          | Cost                                                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cheapest | Piccadilly line or Elizabeth line | 35-40 minutes | ¬£5.60                                                                            |
| Fastest  | Heathrow Express                  | 15 minutes    | ¬£25 one way (you can get ¬£11 return ticket if you book online months in advance) |

## Transportation

Unlike Vancouver, the London Underground charges the same fare for both Oyster card and tap. An Oyster card costs ¬£7, if you're into collecting transit cards, get one. Otherwise, just use your tap phone, watch or credit card.

## My recommended route

If you follow this route, you will see all of the major landmarks in London in a few hours. If you start in the morning you'll get the best light for photos. Feel free to skip any of these places if you're not interested.

It's a 2h36m walk, bring water. I recommend starting at 10-11am, that way you'll get to the Tower Bridge around noon for the sun to shine from above/the south on to the south side of the bridge, and you can have lunch at [Borough Market](#borough-market).

Because of Google Map's 10-waypoint limit, I had to split the route into two parts. Some of the locations are so close to each other I didn't bother adding them to the route. Some places are added so Google Maps would keep you on the interesting route instead of the shortest route.

  This will take you from Oxford Circus to Shakespeare's Globe in 1h31m.

  This will take you from Shakespeare's Globe to Borough Market in 1h5m.

### [Oxford Circus](https://goo.gl/maps/BG7vFcdtoFevnnja9)

![Oxford Circus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Oxford_Circus_Panorama_March_2006.jpg/640px-Oxford_Circus_Panorama_March_2006.jpg)

Think of it as the intersection of Robson St and Granville St in Vancouver. Oxford Circus is one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in London. Located at the intersection of Regent St, a popular shopping street and Oxford St, Europe's busiest shopping street. Both streets are often decorated with some kind of art installation or symbols for special occasions.

### [Piccadilly Circus](https://goo.gl/maps/wsGmVgFinKZS9KpAA)

![Piccadilly Circus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Open_Happiness_Piccadilly_Circus_Blue-Pink_Hour_120917-1126-jikatu.jpg/640px-Open_Happiness_Piccadilly_Circus_Blue-Pink_Hour_120917-1126-jikatu.jpg)

It's London version of New Yorks's Times Square, Piccadilly Circus has a lot of bright lights and big screens.

### [Trafalgar Square](https://goo.gl/maps/x5PWMZHyas1yWrnj7)

![Trafalgar Square](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Trafalgar_Square%2C_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg/640px-Trafalgar_Square%2C_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg)

Trafalgar Square is a popular tourist attraction and a place for political demonstrations. It's also where you'll find the [National Gallery](#national-gallery) and the National Portrait Gallery. To its west is the High Commission of Canada in the United Kingdom. That's what they call an embassy between Commonwealth countries.

### [Admiralty Arch](https://goo.gl/maps/1cSCeEPyG33ioFMRA)

![Admiralty Arch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Admiralty_Arch%2C_London%2C_England_-_June_2009.jpg/640px-Admiralty_Arch%2C_London%2C_England_-_June_2009.jpg)

It's a triumphal arch that leads to The Mall, a road that leads to Buckingham Palace.

### [Buckingham Palace](https://goo.gl/maps/CvJ2x1motPhy5hgHA)

![Buckingham Palace](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Buckingham_Palace%2C_London_-_April_2009.jpg/640px-Buckingham_Palace%2C_London_-_April_2009.jpg)

That's where the King lives, except for the summer when he goes to Balmoral Castle in Scotland. The palace is open to the public during the summer months. Changing of The King‚Äôs Guard takes place in front of Buckingham Palace at 10:45am and lasts for about 45 minutes. You should arrive early to get the best view. I've never seen it, not really my thing.

### [Westminster Abbey](https://goo.gl/maps/isNMrjdJYKQxyLY78)

![Westminster Abbey](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Westminster_Abbey_St_Peter.jpg/386px-Westminster_Abbey_St_Peter.jpg)

It is one of the United Kingdom's most notable religious buildings and the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and, later, British monarchs. The building itself was a Benedictine monastic church until the monastery was dissolved in 1539. Between 1540 and 1556, the abbey had the status of a cathedral. Since 1560, the building is no longer an abbey or a cathedral, having instead the status of a Church of England "Royal Peculiar"‚Äîa church responsible directly to the sovereign.

### [Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament)](https://goo.gl/maps/jcbcDUkScMsRRwoe6)

![Palace of Westminster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Westminster_palace.jpg/640px-Westminster_palace.jpg)

You can go inside for a tour on Saturdays and some weekdays when Parliament is not in session.

### [10 Downing St](https://goo.gl/maps/viaEPKsUU5YpS8Ea8)

![10 Downing St](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/10_Downing_Street._MOD_45155532.jpg/640px-10_Downing_Street._MOD_45155532.jpg)

If you're really into politics and want to see where the Prime Minister lives, you can walk by 10 Downing St. You can't get close to the door, but you can see the building very far away, from the street.

### [Big Ben](https://goo.gl/maps/wzbhyAVdSNdY62KU8)

![Big Ben](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Big_Ben_no3.jpg/320px-Big_Ben_no3.jpg)

If you walk across Westminster Bridge, you'll get a good view of Big Ben and Palace of Westminster. If you get here before noon on a sunny day, the sun will shine on the east side of the building for a good photo.

### [London Eye](https://goo.gl/maps/ub5LvjVx9WEms59i8)

![London Eye](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/London_Eye_-_TQ04_26.jpg/360px-London_Eye_-_TQ04_26.jpg)

A rotation takes around 30 minutes. Going up is kinda meh but that might be mostly because of my fear of heights.

Now Walk along the Thames River to üëáüèº

### [Tate Modern](https://goo.gl/maps/oUfyJZPJkessKmVV9)

![Tate Modern](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Tate_Modern_-_Bankside_Power_Station.jpg/640px-Tate_Modern_-_Bankside_Power_Station.jpg)

It's a modern art gallery located in the former Bankside Power Station. It's free to enter and they have some interesting exhibits. The building itself is also quite interesting.

### [Shakespeare's Globe](https://goo.gl/maps/88KLuFGZAUJzn3XN8)

![Shakespeare's Globe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Restaurante_The_Swan%2C_Londres%2C_Inglaterra%2C_2014-08-11%2C_DD_113.jpg/609px-Restaurante_The_Swan%2C_Londres%2C_Inglaterra%2C_2014-08-11%2C_DD_113.jpg)

It's a reconstruction of the Globe Theatre, an Elizabethan playhouse for which William Shakespeare wrote his plays. The original theatre was built in 1599, destroyed by fire in 1613, rebuilt in 1614, and then demolished in 1644. The modern Globe Theatre reconstruction is an academic approximation based on available evidence of the 1599 and 1614 buildings. It's a popular tourist attraction and they have plays here.

### [Millennium Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/1LEEG3Sh2nhy9HZNA)

![Millennium Bridge](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Millenium_bridge_2015.jpg/360px-Millenium_bridge_2015.jpg)

It's a cool pedestrian bridge. Back when it first opened, it was nicknamed the "Wobbly Bridge" because it resonated with people's walking speed. It took them 2 years to fix by putting dampers all over the place and it's not wobbly anymore.

Once you cross the bridge, you'll be in the City of London. (This CGP Grey video explains the difference between the City of London and London:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrObZ_HZZUc)

### [St Paul's Cathedral](https://goo.gl/maps/MAbiMeqA4GfYRtCf8)

![St Paul's Cathedral](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/St_Pauls_aerial_%28cropped%29.jpg/640px-St_Pauls_aerial_%28cropped%29.jpg)

It's a church that was built in 1675. It's the seat of the Bishop of London and the mother church of the Diocese of London. It's also where Prince Charles and Princess Diana got married.

If you want a see the cathedral from slightly higher up, go to the [Roof Terrace at One New Change](https://goo.gl/maps/JCUaJ7kR1WGdzuDA6). It's free to enter.

### [Bank Junction](https://goo.gl/maps/rxCMaCJW6w6KWEAu8)

![Bank Junction](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Bank_junction_-_2020-09-20_%282%29.jpg/640px-Bank_junction_-_2020-09-20_%282%29.jpg)

This is historic and financial centre of London. Where 6 major roads meet.

Around you will find:

- [Royal Exchange](https://goo.gl/maps/dUsS97D1swdng1Gj8)

  A historic building that was founded in the 16th century to act as a centre of commerce for the City of London. The exchange building has twice been destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt. The present building was built in 1844. It's now a shopping mall.

- [Bank of England](https://goo.gl/maps/rsa1ePdKCew4bkfK8)

  The central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694 to act as the English Government's banker, it is the world's eighth-oldest bank.

- [Mansion House](https://goo.gl/maps/8UM3RMenQrrTHZjf7)

  The official residence of the Lord Mayor of London, who has been elected annually since 1189. This is not the same as the Mayor of London. [This CGP Grey video explains the role of the Lord Mayor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ROpIKZe-c).

### [Bank of England Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/XHQxTYNAoqEpPQVF7)

If you want to feel how heavy a full size gold bar is, there one here you can lift a few centimeters. It's free to enter.

### [The Garden at 120](https://goo.gl/maps/vierjnMTqhZF7tKx7)

![The Garden at 120](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/20_Fenchurch_Street_from_The_Garden_at_120_1.jpg/640px-20_Fenchurch_Street_from_The_Garden_at_120_1.jpg)

It's a rooftop garden on top of a building with a great view of the city. It's free to enter. Hopefully it hasn't gotten too crowded with tourists.

### [Roman Wall](https://goo.gl/maps/7oPqVSm4D4X6dZHdA)

![Roman Wall](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/London_Wall_fragment.jpg)

This place might be hard to find, you'll have to walk through Leonardo Royal Hotel London City to get to it. It's a section of the old Roman London wall that once enclosed the City of London.

### [London Wall](https://goo.gl/maps/aT6FB3zcMHbr9zyQ7)

This is another section of the old Roman London wall. It's a bit easier to find.

### [Tower of London](https://goo.gl/maps/rNPvLC1PTZZ4GLkV8)

![Tower of London](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Tower_of_London_from_the_Shard_%288515883950%29.jpg/640px-Tower_of_London_from_the_Shard_%288515883950%29.jpg)

It's a historic castle founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 until 1952, although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence.

The Crown Jewels are kept here. They're on display when they're not being used by the Royal Family.

I highly recommend the guided tour here.

### [Tower Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/kJtzFZsf5eQdsWCi9)

![Tower Bridge](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/London_-_London_Tower_Bridge_-_140806_171049.jpg/640px-London_-_London_Tower_Bridge_-_140806_171049.jpg)

It's an iconic symbol of London. It was built in 1894 designed to look older than it actually is. Hopefully you got here at around noon on a sunny day and you can get a good photo of it.

### [London City Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/8kUQ1HWq1uwWRzW26)

![London City Hall](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/London_City_Hall.jpg/640px-London_City_Hall.jpg)

This was the headquarters of the Greater London Authority (GLA) until 2021.

### [HMS Belfast](https://goo.gl/maps/MNgGWDqZa8e7eqo29)

![HMS Belfast](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/London_November_2013-14a.jpg/640px-London_November_2013-14a.jpg)

This ship was built in 1936 and served in the Royal Navy until 1963. It has served in the Korean War and World War II. It's now a museum ship and you can go on board.

### [Borough Market](https://goo.gl/maps/g84jMdZTE2HaJVuj6)

![Borough Market](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/London_2018_March_IMG_0663.jpg/640px-London_2018_March_IMG_0663.jpg)

It's like the Granville Island Public Market in Vancouver. You can get lunch here or take the tube to Soho.

## Building Nicknames

Londoners like to give buildings nicknames based on their shape. Here are some of the more famous ones:

- [The Gherkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_St_Mary_Axe)
